## Instructions

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy a virtual machine that will be used to test monitoring scenarios.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and click **Create storage**. 

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, click **Upload** and upload the files **\\Allfiles\\Labs\\11\\az104-11-vm-template.json** and **\\Allfiles\\Labs\\11\\az104-11-vm-parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the resource group that will be hosting the virtual machines (replace the `[Azure_region]` placeholder with the name of an Azure region where you intend to deploy Azure virtual machines):

    >**Note**: Make sure to choose one of the regions listed as **Log Analytics Workspace Region** in the referenced in [Workspace mappings documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/how-to/region-mappings)

   ```pwsh
   $location = '[Azure_region]'

   $rgName = 'az104-11-rg0'

   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName -Location $location
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the first virtual network and deploy a virtual machine into it by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-11-vm-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-11-vm-parameters.json `
      -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next task. The deployment should take about 3 minutes.
    
#### Task 2: Register the Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement resource providers.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to register the Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement resource providers.

   ```pwsh
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Insights
   
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AlertsManagement
   ```

1. Minimize Cloud Shell pane (but do not close it).

#### Task 3: Create and configure an Azure Log Analytics workspace and Azure Automation-based solutions

In this task, you will create and configure an Azure Log Analytics workspace and Azure Automation-based solutions

#### Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'az104-11*'
   ```

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'az104-11*' | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
